# Energy-Sanity

Detailed analysis and prediction of a few stocks using Recurrent Neural Networks: 

- Cenovus Energy (CVE.TSX)
- MEG Energy (MEG.TSX)

**NOTE**: The stock market is a non-stationary process that **cannot** be predicted with this simple approach. However, this model is just to see how much prediction accuracy a naive RNN can provide to this non-stationary process.
